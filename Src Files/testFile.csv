I've included it as a baseline to compare against the other versions. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant.

It seems very feature-complete and nicely integrated into the Windows shell, and more importantly, it's fairly painless to teach to colleagues with little or no experience with source control.  <strong>However</strong>, since we have moved to Windows Vista 64bit, Tortoise has been very buggy and has seemed to cause lots of explorer.exe abnormalities and crashes.  This has happened both with older versions of the software and the latest version (1.5.1 build 13563).</p>

<p>I was curious if anyone has suggestions for other Subversion clients that will run on Windows (specifically Vista 64bit).  Developers here use a variety of text editors so using Visual Studio or Dreamweaver for SVN is not ideal.</p>

Without going into details, the attack attempts to execute SQL code by encoding the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL"" rel=""noreferrer"">T-SQL</a> commands in an ASCII encoded BINARY string. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE%20@S%20NVARCHAR(4000);SET%20@S=CAST(0x44004500...06F007200%20AS%20NVARCHAR(4000));EXEC(@S);--
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to decode this in SQL, but I was a little wary of doing this since I didn't know exactly what was happening at the time.</p>

<p>I tried to write a simple decode tool, so I could decode this type of text without even touching <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQL&nbsp;Server</a>. The main part I need decoded is:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(0x44004500...06F007200 AS
NVARCHAR(4000))
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried all of the following commands with no luck:</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text =
    System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlDecode(txtURLText.Text);
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.ASCII.GetString(Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes(txtURLText.Text));
txtDecodedText.Text =
    Encoding.Unicode.GetString(Convert.FromBase64String(txtURLText.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>What is the proper way to translate this encoding without using SQL Server? Is it possible? I'll take VB.NET code since I'm familiar with that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>Okay, I'm sure I'm missing something here, so here's where I'm at.</p>

<p>Since my input is a basic string, I started with just a snippet of the encoded portion - 4445434C41 (which translates to DECLA) - and the first attempt was to do this...</p>

<pre><code>txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(txtURL.Text));
</code></pre>

<p>...and all it did was return the exact same thing that I put in, since it converted each character into is byte.</p>

<p>I realized that I need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since I don't know of any methods yet that will do that, so now my little decoder looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (!boolIsDone)
{
    bytURLChar = byte.Parse(txtURLText.Text.Substring(intParseIndex, 2));
    bytURL[intURLIndex] = bytURLChar;
    intParseIndex += 2;
    intURLIndex++;

    if (txtURLText.Text.Length - intParseIndex &lt; 2)
    {
        boolIsDone = true;
    }
}

txtDecodedText.Text = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytURL);
</code></pre>

<p>Things look good for the first couple of pairs, but then the loop balks when it gets to the ""4C"" pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when I step through the debugger and to the GetString method on the byte array that I was able to parse up to that point, I get "",-+"" as the result.</p>

<p>How do I figure out what I'm missing - do I need to do a ""direct cast"" for each byte instead of attempting to parse it?</p>

It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well.

<p>That stipulated, what is the best way to migrate from <code>6.5</code> to <code>2005</code>?  Is there any direct path?  Most of the documentation I've found deals with upgrading <code>6.5</code> to <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>I was going to attempt the upgrade this weekend, but server issues pushed it back till next.  So, any ideas would be welcomed during the course of the week.</p>

<p><em>Update.  This is how I ended up doing it:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Back up the database in question and Master on <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Execute <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s <code>instcat.sql</code> against <code>6.5</code>'s Master.  This allows <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s OLEDB provider to connect to <code>6.5</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>SQL Server 2000</code>'s standalone <code>""Import and Export Data""</code> to create a DTS package, using <code>OLEDB</code> to connect to 6.5.  This successfully copied all <code>6.5</code>'s tables to a new <code>2005</code> database (also using <code>OLEDB</code>).</li>
<li>Use <code>6.5</code>'s Enterprise Manager to script out all of the database's indexes and triggers to a .sql file.</li>
<li>Execute that .sql file against the new copy of the database, in 2005's Management Studio.</li>
<li>Use 6.5's Enterprise Manager to script out all of the stored procedures.</li>
<li>Execute that <code>.sql</code> file against the <code>2005</code> database.  Several dozen sprocs had issues making them incompatible with <code>2005</code>.  Mainly <code>non-ANSI joins</code> and <code>quoted identifier issues</code>.</li>
<li>Corrected all of those issues and re-executed the <code>.sql</code> file.</li>
<li>Recreated the <code>6.5</code>'s logins in <code>2005</code> and gave them appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a bit of rinse/repeat when correcting the stored procedures (there were hundreds of them to correct), but the upgrade went great otherwise.</p>

<p>Being able to use Management Studio instead of <code>Query Analyzer</code> and <code>Enterprise Manager 6.5</code> is such an amazing difference.

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings, and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

<ol>

<li>This isn't something the installer should be doing, but something the application should be doing (after all what happens when a user profile is created after the install?).</li>
</ol>

<p>With that in mind, I still want to change as little as possible in the application, so my question is, <strong>is it possible to add registry entries for every user in a <code>Visual Studio 2003</code> setup project?</strong> </p>

<p>And, at the moment the project lists five registry root keys (<code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code>, <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code>, <code>HKEY_USERS</code>, and User/Machine Hive). I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

128,1069,1073,15,"<p>I'm working on a <strong>multithreaded</strong> C++ application that is corrupting the heap.  The usual tools to locate this corruption seem to be inapplicable.  Old builds (18 months old) of the source code exhibit the same behaviour as the most recent release, so this has been around for a long time and just wasn't noticed; on the downside, source deltas can't be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are <em>a lot</em> of code changes in the repository.</p>

<p>The prompt for crashing behaviuor is to generate throughput in this system - socket transfer of data which is munged into an internal representation.  I have a set of test data that will periodically cause the app to exception (various places, various causes - including heap alloc failing, thus: heap corruption).</p>

<p>The behaviour seems related to CPU power or memory bandwidth; the more of each the machine has, the easier it is to crash.  Disabling a hyper-threading core or a dual-core core reduces the rate of (but does not eliminate) corruption.  This suggests a timing related issue.</p>

<p>Now here's the rub:<br>
When it's run under a lightweight debug environment (say <code>Visual Studio 98 / AKA MSVC6</code>) the heap corruption is reasonably easy to reproduce - ten or fifteen minutes pass before something fails horrendously and exceptions, like an <code>alloc;</code> when running under a sophisticated debug environment (Rational Purify, <code>VS2008/MSVC9</code> or even Microsoft Application Verifier) the system becomes memory-speed bound and doesn't crash (Memory-bound: CPU is not getting above <code>50%</code>, disk light is not on, the program's going as fast it can, box consuming <code>1.3G</code> of 2G of RAM).  So, <strong>I've got a choice between being able to reproduce the problem (but not identify the cause) or being able to idenify the cause or a problem I can't reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>My current best guesses as to where to next is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an insanely grunty box (to replace the current dev box: 2Gb RAM in an <code>E6550 Core2 Duo</code>); this will make it possible to repro the crash causing mis-behaviour when running under a powerful debug environment; or</li>
<li>Rewrite operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> to use <code>VirtualAlloc</code> and <code>VirtualProtect</code> to mark memory as read-only as soon as it's done with.  Run under <code>MSVC6</code> and have the OS catch the bad-guy who's writing to freed memory.  Yes, this is a sign of desperation: who the hell rewrites <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>?!  I wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under Purify et al.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, no: Shipping with Purify instrumentation built in is not an option.</p>

<p>A colleague just walked past and asked ""Stack Overflow?  Are we getting stack overflows now?!?""</p>

<p>And now, the question: <strong>How do I locate the heap corruptor?</strong></p>

<p>Update: balancing <code>new[]</code> and <code>delete[]</code> seems to have gotten a long way towards solving the problem.  Instead of 15mins, the app now goes about two hours before crashing.  Not there yet.  Any further suggestions? The heap corruption persists.</p>

<p>Update: a release build under Visual Studio 2008 seems dramatically better; current suspicion rests on the <code>STL</code> implementation that ships with <code>VS98</code>.</p>

<p>I'll take a note of that, but I'm concerned that Dr Watson will only be tripped up after the fact, not when the heap is getting stomped on.</p>

133,1131,1135,10,"<p>Back in the old days, Help was not trivial but possible: generate some funky .rtf file with special tags, run it through a compiler, and you got a WinHelp file (.hlp) that actually works really well.</p>

<p>Then, Microsoft decided that WinHelp was not hip and cool anymore and switched to CHM, up to the point they actually axed WinHelp from Vista.</p>

<p>Now, CHM maybe nice, but everyone that tried to open a .chm file on the Network will know the nice ""Navigation to the webpage was canceled"" screen that is caused by security restrictions.</p>

<p>While there are ways to make CHM work off the network, this is hardly a good choice, because when a user presses the Help Button he wants help and not have to make some funky settings.</p>

<p>Bottom Line: I find CHM absolutely unusable. But with WinHelp not being an option anymore either, I wonder what the alternatives are, especially when it comes to integrate with my Application (i.e. for WinHelp and CHM there are functions that allow you to directly jump to a topic)?</p>

<p>PDF has the disadvantage of requiring the Adobe Reader (or one of the more lightweight ones that not many people use). I could live with that seeing as this is kind of standard nowadays, but can you tell it reliably to jump to a given page/anchor?</p>

<p>HTML files seem to be the best choice, you then just have to deal with different browsers (CSS and stuff).</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> I am looking to create my own Help Files. As I am a fan of the ""No Setup, Just Extract and Run"" Philosophy, i had that problem many times in the past because many of my users will run it off the network, which causes exactly this problem.</p>

<p>So i am looking for a more robust and future-proof way to provide help to my users without having to code a different help system for each application i make.</p>

<p>CHM is a really nice format, but that Security Stuff makes it unusable, as a Help system is supposed to provide help to the user, not to generate even more problems.</p>

134,1145,1154,8,"<p>I've tried to write a string replace function in C, which works on a <code>char *</code>, which has been allocated using <code>malloc()</code>.  It's a little different in that it will find and replace strings, rather than characters in the starting string.</p>

<p>It's trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length (or the replace string is shorter than the search string), since I have enough space allocated.  If I try to use <code>realloc()</code>, I get an error that tells me I am doing a double free - which I don't see how I am, since I am only using <code>realloc()</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little code will help:</p>

<pre><code>void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace) {
    int searchLen = strlen(search);
    int replaceLen = strlen(replace);
    int delta = replaceLen - searchLen;
    char *find = input;

    while (find = strstr(find, search)) {

        if (delta &gt; 0) {
            realloc(input, strlen(input) + delta);
            find = strstr(input, search);            
        }

        memmove(find + replaceLen, find + searchLen, strlen(input) - (find - input));
        memmove(find, replace, replaceLen);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program works, until I try to <code>realloc()</code> in an instance where the replaced string will be longer than the initial string.  (It still kind of works, it just spits out errors as well as the result).</p>

<p>If it helps, the calling code looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void strrep(char *input, char *search, char *replace);

int main(void) {
    char *input = malloc(81);

    while ((fgets(input, 81, stdin)) != NULL) {
        strrep(input, ""Noel"", ""Christmas"");
    }
}

<p>Yes, I should have been a bit clearer on what I mean by efficiency. In this particular case I mean it in terms of random access retrieval.</p>

314580,314729,7,"<p><b>Executive Summary:</b> When assertion errors are thrown in the threads, the unit test doesn't die. This makes sense, since one thread shouldn't be allowed to crash another thread. The question is how do I either 1) make the whole test fail when the first of the helper threads crashes or 2) loop through and determine the state of each thread after they have all completed (see code below). One way of doing the latter is by having a per thread status variable, e.g., ""boolean[] statuses"" and have ""statuses[i] == false"" mean that the thread failed (this could be extended to capture more information). However, that is not what I want: I want it to fail just like any other unit test when the assertion errors are thrown. Is this even possible? Is it desirable?</p>  <p>I got bored and I decided to spawn a bunch of threads in my unit test and then have them call a service method, just for the heck of it. The code looks approximately like:</p>  <pre><code>Thread[] threads = new Thread[MAX_THREADS]; for( int i = 0; i &lt; threads.length; i++ ) {     threads[i] = new Thread( new Runnable() {         private final int ID = threadIdSequenceNumber++;         public void run() {             try {                 resultRefs[ID] = runTest( Integer.toString( ID ) ); // returns an object             }             catch( Throwable t ) {                  // this code is EVIL - it catches even                 // Errors - don't copy it - more on this below                 final String message = ""error testing thread with id =&gt; ""                             + ID;                 logger.debug( message, t );                 throw new IllegalStateException( message, t );                  // need to wrap throwable in a                  // run time exception so it will compile             }         }     } ); } </code></pre>  <p>After this, we will loop through the array of threads and start each one. After that we will wait for them all to finish. Finally, we will perform some checks on the result references.</p>  <pre><code>for( Thread thread : threads )     thread.start();  logger.debug( ""waiting for threads to finish ..."" ); boolean done = false; while( !done ) {     done = true;     for( Thread thread : threads )         if( thread.isAlive() )             done = false; }  for( int i = 0; i &lt; resultRefs.length; i++ ) {     assertTrue( ""you've got the world messed, dawg!"",             myCondition(resultRefs[i]) ); </code></pre>  <p>Here's the problem. Did you notice that nasty try-catch-throwable block? I just added that as a temporary hack so I could see what was going on. In runTest( String ) a few assertions are made, e.g., assertNotNull( null ), but since it is in a different thread, it doesn't cause the unit test to fail!!!!</p>  <p>My guess is that we will need to somehow iterate over the threads array, check the status of each, and manually cause an assertion error if the thread terminated in a nasty way.

480632,481404,12,"<p>Does anyone know why  <code>java.lang.Number</code> does not implement <code>Comparable</code>? This means that you cannot sort <code>Number</code>s with <code>Collections.sort</code> which seems to me a little strange.</p>  <p><strong>Post discussion update:</strong></p>  <p>Thanks for all the helpful responses. I ended up doing <a href=""http://radioeiffel.blogspot.com/2009/02/what-java-can-sort-numbers.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">some more research about this topic</a>.</p>  <p>The simplest explanation for why java.lang.Number does not implement Comparable is rooted in mutability concerns.</p>  <p>For a bit of review, <code>java.lang.Number</code> is the abstract super-type of <code>AtomicInteger</code>, <code>AtomicLong</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>, <code>BigInteger</code>, <code>Byte</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Long</code> and <code>Short</code>. On that list, <code>AtomicInteger</code> and <code>AtomicLong</code> to do not implement <code>Comparable</code>.</p>  <p>Digging around, I discovered that it is not a good practice to implement <code>Comparable</code> on mutable types because the objects can change during or after comparison rendering the result of the comparison useless. Both <code>AtomicLong</code> and <code>AtomicInteger</code> are mutable. The API designers had the forethought to not have <code>Number</code> implement <code>Comparable</code> because it would have constrained implementation of future subtypes.

But I came across 2 hurdles. </p>  <ol> <li><p>A lot of the layout stuff that I need to do were already done on the other pages and if I  use divs instead, I cant reuse any of that (CSS's and JS and that kinda stuff). That leads to more work and pushes out my completion date.</p></li> <li><p>Some of the more complex parts of the layout are really difficult to do using divs and are really easy to do using tables.

709876,709977,7,"<p>I have an application that I am writing that modifies data on a cached object in the server.  The modifications are performed through an ajax call that basically updates properties of that object.  When the user is done working, I have a basic 'Save Changes' button that allows them to Save the data and flush the cached object.</p>  <p>In order to protect the user, I want to warn them if the try to navigate away from the page when modifications have been made to the server object if they have not saved.  So, I created a web service method called IsInitialized that will return true or false based on whether or not changes have been saved.  If they have not been saved, I want to prompt the user and give them a chance to cancel their navigation request.</p>  <p>Here's my problem - although I have the calls working correctly, I can't seem to get the ajax success call to set the variable value on its callback function.  Here's the code I have now.</p>  <pre><code>   ////Catches the users to keep them from navigation off the page w/o saved changes... window.onbeforeunload = CheckSaveStatus; var IsInitialized;  function CheckSaveStatus() {      var temp = $.ajax({         type: ""POST"",         url: ""URL.asmx/CheckIfInstanceIsInitilized"",         data: ""{}"",         contentType: ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",         dataType: ""json"",         success: function(result) {             IsInitialized = result.d;         },         error: function(xmlHttpRequest, status, err) {             alert(xmlHttpRequest.statusText + "" "" + xmlHttpRequest.status + "" : "" + xmlHttpRequest.responseText);         }      });      if (IsInitialized) {         return ""You currently have unprocessed changes for this Simulation."";     } } </code></pre>  <p>I feel that I might be trying to use the Success callback in an inappropriate manner.

Simple enough. When the custom control renders, it should dynamically create a Button, associate an event handler to it (which will also be defined inside the server control) and add this button to the rendered control. The click event handler defined inside the server control does some job which for the moment isn't interesting.</p>  <p>I already coded an example and that works fine. In the constructor of the server control I create a new button control, give it an ID, associate an event handler, on the OnInit of the server control I add the button to the Panel controls (remember, my control inherits from Panel) and then everything gets rendered. This looks something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>public class MyCustomControl: Panel     {         private Button myButton;          public MyCustomControl()         {             myButton = new Button();             myButton.ID = ""btnTest"";             myButton.Click += new EventHandler(btnTest_Click);         }          protected void btnTest_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)         {             //do something...         }          //...          protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)         {             base.OnInit(e);              this.Controls.AddAt(0, myButton);         }          protected override void OnLoad(EventArgs e)         {             base.OnLoad(e);             //...         }          protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e)         {             base.OnPreRender(e);         }           protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter output)         {             base.RenderContents(output);         }     } </code></pre>  <p>This works quite fine. The button gets rendered correctly and when I click on it, the appropriate handler inside this customer server control is invoked and executed. Now the problem however starts when I would like to add multiple instances of this server control to my page because all of my generated buttons will have the same id ""btnTest"" which results in a conflict. So what I tried is to associate a random number to the id of the button, s.t. it end up being ""btnTest1235512"" or something similar. This solves my problem with the multiple IDs, but results in the problem that my event handler when clicking on the button is no more called correctly. I guess this is due to the problem that my button always gets another id when entering in the constructor and so the appropriate callback (btnTest_Click event handler) isn't found.</p>  <p>Can someone give me a suggestion how I could handle the problem. Is there some way for remembering the ID of the button and re-associating it. As far as I know however this has to happen in the OnInit, where the ViewState isn't yet available. So storing the id in the ViewState wouldn't work.</p>  <p>Any suggestions??</p> ",2012-07-14 01:59:34.477,1,NULL,2009-04-07 12:50:16.713,0,2009-04-07 13:05:45.940,2017-05-23 11:55:03.767,NULL,-1,50109,0,1,1,<asp.net><controls>,ASP.net Server controls: How to handle ID of dynamic controls,5419,699677

The data returned from <code>SELECT</code> calls isn't massive (no more than 30 records returned by using <code>LIMIT</code>). There will also not be a whole lot of <code>INSERT</code>s. The site is currently not live and so making changes now is easy.</p>  <p>In your professional opinions, is it worth my time to switch the site over to PDO from MySQL?

If you are using Java 7 or later you should advance to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/21723193"">the answer of Ross Johnson</a>.</p>  <hr>  <p>What is considered the best, most comprehensive way to close nested streams in Java? For example, consider the setup:</p>  <pre><code>FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(...) BufferedOS bos = new BufferedOS(fos); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos); </code></pre>  <p>I understand the close operation needs to be insured (probably by using a finally clause). What I wonder about is, is it necessary to explicitly make sure the nested streams are closed, or is it enough to just make sure to close the outer stream (oos)?</p>  <p>One thing I notice, at least dealing with this specific example, is that the inner streams only seem to throw FileNotFoundExceptions. Which would seem to imply that there's not technically a need to worry about closing them if they fail.</p>  <p>Here's what a colleague wrote:</p>  <hr>  <p>Technically, if it were implemented right, closing the outermost stream (oos) should be enough. But the implementation seems flawed.</p>  <p>Example: BufferedOutputStream inherits close() from FilterOutputStream, which defines it as:</p>  <pre><code> 155       public void close() throws IOException {  156           try {  157             flush();  158           } catch (IOException ignored) {  159           }  160           out.close();  161       } </code></pre>  <p>However, if flush() throws a runtime exception for some reason, then out.close() will never be called. So it seems ""safest"" (but ugly) to mostly worry about closing FOS, which is keeping the file open.</p>  <hr>  <p>What is considered to be the hands-down best, when-you-absolutely-need-to-be-sure, approach to closing nested streams?</p>  <p>And are there any official Java/Sun docs that deal with this in fine detail?</p> ",2016-07-08 10:17:01.163,0,NULL,2009-05-19 17:14:31.257,24,2016-07-08 10:15:29.437,2017-05-23 11:33:26.740,NULL,-1,109474,0,1,88,<java><java-io>,Correct way to close nested streams and writers in Java,31681,28276423

But when I have it generate a script from that, it seems unnecessarily complex.

He was disturbed by the fact that most books he found are about 10 years old and probably outdated (don't worry he found the usual suspects including Charles Petzold). Till today I was reluctant to post any comment on his site, because I simply am unable to answer him. Certainly Windows programming has changed since then and split in many different direction, but where is it going?</p>  <p>A couple of years ago Win32 was certainly THE way to program for Windows in one way or the other. Reasonable fast, a lot of examples and so on. However due to the shift to .NET (heard the fourth incarnation is coming...) there seems to be a change. Although the old API still stands and quite some .net code uses it, it more and more seems to me that it loses its importance. Certainly there are a couple of reasons: First of all C# (.net) with all advantages in giving the programmer a modern language is supersedeing C/C++ in many regards. Another one is that in my personal opinion MS with its VS IDE privileges the development of .NET application very much, but why is it? I mean why there are so many cool features developing in c# and it seems to me that win32/c is some semi-finished thing (eg. the Designer)? Another thing is, that Win32 question on Codeproject and many other forums become less frequent by the month. One last thing I want to add is that all modern fancy GUI/Network frameworks are designed for .NET (Dundas etc..), which makes rapid development very easy and leaves not much room for the old guys...</p>  <p>To make it short: Where do you think Win32 is going, has it any future, should newcomers learn it or will it be outdated and gone within the next years?

Below is what I'm trying to do:</p>  <ol> <li>I've a JSF web application running on JBoss AS 5</li> <li>When the user is inactive for, say 15 minutes, I need to log out the user and redirect him to the login page, if he is trying to use the application after the session has expired.</li> <li>So, as suggested in '<a href=""http://www.jroller.com/hasant/entry/jsf_logout_and_redirect_user"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JSF Logout and Redirect</a>', I've implemented a filter which checks for the session expired condition and redirects the user to a session-timed-out.jsp page, if the session has expired.</li> <li>I've added SessionExpiryCheckFilter on top of all other filter definitions in web.xml, so that my session expiry check will get the first hit always.</li> </ol>  <p>Now comes the <strong>challenge I'm facing</strong>. Since I'm using JBoss AS, when the session expired, JBoss automatically redirects me to the login page (note that the session expiry check filter is not invoked). So, after I log-in, my SessionExpiryCheckFilter intercepts the request, and it sees a session is available. But, it throws the exception <code>javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException: viewId:/mypage.faces - View /mypage.faces could not be restored.</code></p>  <p>Have anyone faced this issue before?

This ensures that we always get our hands on the same copy of data, since when we designed, we said that only once instance is allowed to exist during the application lifetime.</p>  <p>From this central data repository, it's then easy for us to for example, dispatch property changed events, and can have multiple UI components that reference the central data, update their displays to reflect the data changes that have occurred.</p>  <p>So far, this approach has been effective and proven very practical to our circumstances.</p>  <p>I'm finding however, that I'm a little overeager when creating new classes.

In C#, this is not the case if the parent method is not labeled with the ""virtual"" modifier.  Example:</p>  <pre><code>public class Parent {     public void NonVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""Non-Virtual Parent""); }     public virtual void Virtual(){ Console.WriteLine(""Virtual Parent""); } }  public class Child : Parent {     public new void NonVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""Non-Virtual Child""); }     public override void Virtual() { Console.WriteLine(""Virtual Child""); } }  public class Program {     public static void Main(string[] args)     {         Child child = new Child();         Parent parent = new Child();         var anon = new Child();          child.NonVirtual();           // =&gt; Child         parent.NonVirtual();          // =&gt; Parent         anon.NonVirtual();            // =&gt; Child         ((Parent)child).NonVirtual(); // =&gt; Parent          child.Virtual();              // =&gt; Child         parent.Virtual();             // =&gt; Child         anon.Virtual();               // =&gt; Child         ((Parent)child).Virtual();    // =&gt; Child     } } </code></pre>  <p>What exactly are the benefits of the non-virtual behavior observed above?  The only thing I could think of was ""What if the author of Parent doesn't want his method to be virtual?"" but then I realized I couldn't think of a good use case for that.  One might argue that the behavior of the class is dependent on how a non-virtual method operates - but then that seems to me there is some poor encapsulation going on, or that the method should be sealed.</p>  <p>Along these same lines, it seems like 'hiding' is normally a bad idea.  After all, if a Child object and methods were created, it seems that it was done so for a specific reason to override the Parent.  And if Child implements (and hides the parents) NonVirtual(), it is super easy to <em>not</em> get the what many might consider ""expected"" behavior of calling Child::NonVirtual().  (I say ""expected"" because it is sometimes easy to not notice 'hiding' is happening).</p>  <p>So, what are the benefits of not allowing everything to have ""virtual"" behavior?  What is a good use-case for hiding a non-virtual parent if it's so easy to get unexpected behavior?</p>  <p>If anyone is curious as to why I pose this question - I was recently examining Castle Projects DynamicProxy library.  The one main hurdle in using it is that any method (or property) you want to proxy has to be virtual.  And this isn't always an option for developers (if we don't have control over the source).  Not to mention the purpose of DynamicProxy is to avoid-coupling between your proxied class and whatever behavior you are trying to achieve with the proxy (such as Logging, or perhaps a Memoization implementation).  And by forcing virtual methods to accomplish this what is instead achieved is very thin but obtuse coupling of DynamicProxy to all the classes it is proxying - Imagine, you have a ton of methods labeled virtual even though they are never inherited and overridden, so any other developer looking at the code might wonder ""why are these even virtual? lets change them back"".</p>  <p>Anyway, the frustration there led me to wonder what the benefits are of non-virtual, when it seems having everything virtual might have been more clear (IMO, I suppose) and perhaps(?) have more benefits.</p>  <p>EDIT: Labeling as community wiki, since it seems like a question that might have subjective answers</p> ",2009-06-30 21:56:17.337,4,2009-06-30 21:29:34.457,2009-06-30 21:29:34.457,7,2009-06-30 21:44:33.240,2017-05-23 12:26:26.863,NULL,-1,17803,0,1,17,<c#><.net><virtual><override>,Why not make everything 'virtual'?,9124,814934

If you don't, the check of comparing it to null could possibly return false even though the instance constructor hasn't finished running. In Mr. Skeet's third sample, he states this clearly: ""The Java memory model doesn't ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object is assigned to instance. The Java memory model underwent a reworking for version 1.5, but double-check locking is still broken after this without a volatile variable (as in C#)""</p>  <p>However, most everyone agrees (including Mr. Skeet, in samples four and five in his article), that the use of static initialization is a simple way to get a threadsafe singleton instance. He states that ""static constructors in C# are specified to execute only when an instance of the class is created or a static member is referenced, and to execute only once per AppDomain.""</p>  <p>That makes sense, but what seems to be missing is the guarantee that the reference to the new object is assigned only after the constructor completes - otherwise we'd get the same kind of issue that makes double-check locking fail unless you mark the instance as volatile. Is there a guarantee that, when using static initialization to call the instance constructor (as opposed to calling the instance constructor from a property's get{}, like we do with double-check locking), that the constructor will fully complete before any other thread can get a reference to the object?</p>  <p>Thanks!</p> ",2012-09-13 19:23:32.467,1,NULL,2009-08-13 07:36:25.167,4,2012-03-22 17:15:22.047,2017-05-23 12:30:43.360,NULL,-1,0,0,1,7,<c#><constructor><singleton><multithreading>,Static initialization guarantees singleton thread safety?

However, I want each  in the collection to be a copy, rather than just the collection being a copy.</p>  <p>An example:</p>  <pre><code>// some random data from L2S var data = (from p in sourceData            select new            {                a = 1,                b = ""hello"",            }).ToArray();  var dataCopy = data.Copy(); // somehow i want 'dataCopy' to be a deep copy of 'data'  foreach (var d in dataCopy) {     // alter the item in the collection somehow     d.b = d.b + ""1""; }  // combine both sets of data var finalData = data.Union(dataCopy); </code></pre>  <p>So the collection 'finalData' has twice as many items as 'data' or 'dataCopy'.
